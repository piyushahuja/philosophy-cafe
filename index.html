    <h1>Philosophy Cafe</h1>
     <img src="/athens.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>Philosophy Cafe offers an alternative form of learning to structural academic learning. We invite thinkers to discuss questions which are timeless and universal. </p>
    
    <p>While content and forums are free, we ask for the price of a coffee for our conversation salons. This is in keeping up with the tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_coffeehouses_in_the_17th_and_18th_centuries">medieval coffeehouses ("penny universities")</a>, which spurred creativity and innovation during the age of enlightenment in Europe. </p>
  
      <p>Our salons are meant for people to mingle, exchange ideas and inspire each other in their personal, professional and creative lives. In a world of unaffortable university fees and high economic inequality, our salons invite people from all levels of society. Anyone who can afford a coffee is able to join in.</p>
