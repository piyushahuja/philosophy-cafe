    <h1>Penny University</h1>
     <img src="/athens.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>At Penny University, we discuss questions that are timeless and universal. It offers an alternative form of learning to structured academic learning. </p>
    
    <p>Our salons are meant for people to exchange ideas and inspire each other in their personal, professional and creative lives. In a world of high university fees and economic inequality, our discussions invite people from all levels of society. Anyone who can afford a coffee is able to join in.</p>

    <p>We ask for the price of a coffee for our conversation salons. This is in keeping up with the tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_coffeehouses_in_the_17th_and_18th_centuries">medieval coffeehouses ("penny universities")</a>, which spurred creativity and innovation during the age of enlightenment in Europe. </p>
