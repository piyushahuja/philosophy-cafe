    <p>At Penny University, we discuss ideas developed as answers to some of the most profound questions in philosophical and political thought</p>
    
    <p>Our salons are a way for people to exchange ideas and inspire each other in their personal, professional and creative lives. In a world of high university fees and economic inequality, our discussions offers an conversational learning space to people from all levels of society. Anyone who can afford a coffee is able to join in.</p>

    <p>The "coffee-as-entry-price" is in keeping up with the tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_coffeehouses_in_the_17th_and_18th_centuries">medieval coffeehouses ("penny universities")</a>, which spurred creativity and innovation during the age of enlightenment in Europe. The donations help pay for the server, domain and other maintenance costs.  </p>
